# Rshell

This is the Rshell project by Liang Xu and Patrick Porter for CS100 Fall 2017. Rshell is a command shell in C++ that takes in commands from the user and executes them. Rshell supports execution of many commands separated by connectors. This shell executes any command in bin that any normal terminal would.

## Known Bugs

- The cd command is not supported, as it is not in the bin folder.
